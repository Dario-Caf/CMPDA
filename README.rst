Personal repository for physics computation and visualization!
--------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find the basics of Python, C, C++, ROOT and quantum computing.

Codes and materials come from different resources: the most are from the
"Computing methods for experimental physics and data analysis" and "Metodi
numerici" courses of the University of Pisa. All sources are cited into the
documentation and into the README file of each directory.

Here you can also find numerical algorithms, machine learning stuff and
general physics scripts.

Use this repository as an example of complete project: `EM`_
