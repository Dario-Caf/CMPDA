Personal repository for physics computation and visualization!
--------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find the basics of python, C, C++, ROOT, Fortran and quantum computing.

Codes and materials come from different resources: the most are from the
"Computing methods for experimental physics and data analysis" and "Metodi
numerici" courses of the University of Pisa, and another consistent piece comes
from the "Fisica computazionale" course of the University of Salerno. All
sources are linked into the documentation or into the README file of the
relative directories.

Some of the contents are numerical algorithms, machine learning stuff and
general physics scripts.
